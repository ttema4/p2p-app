# 🚀 P2P App - Description of the project

Our project is a **tool for analyzing cryptocurrency markets** and finding opportunities for profitable arbitrage. **The server** part **collects** and **analyzes** **data** from various Peer-to-Peer trading platforms, and **the application** **displays** **the results** of this analysis, opening **new** **prospects** for **investing** and **financial transactions** in the world of **cryptocurrencies**.

* **Server Technology Stack:** Boost::asio, NLohmann, Decimal, Magic Enum, moodycamel::ConcurrentQueue
* **Application Technology Stack:** Qt6, NLohmann, MySQL, Boost::asio.


> ***The application is coded, built and tested under Clang++17, macOS.***

## 🛠️ How to build?

``` shell
cmake -B build && cmake --build build && cmake --install build
```

To run the feed handler, you need to create a folder named 'exchange scraper_' in Users, and run install.sh to install and configure Python. Some commands that should have been in install.sh but were forgotten are - cd '/Users/exchange scraper_/htx scraper' && pip install requests.

<summary><b>FAQ</b></summary>

The parser may not find the requests library:

```bash
pip install requests
```

The parser may not find the Boost::asio:

```cmake

find_package(Boost 1.65 REQUIRED COMPONENTS system)
target_link_libraries(markets_scraper PRIVATE Boost::system)
```
to cmake exchange_scraper.

## 🧩 Architecture

### 🔄 Crypto Exchange Parser

This microservice performs the following functions:

- Parsing data from crypto exchanges.
- Formatting data into a convenient **JSON** format.
- Sending data over **TCP**.

### 🔍 Arbitration Bundles search service

This microservice provides the following functions:

- Receiving data from the first microservice over **TCP**.
- Search for arbitrage bundles of cryptocurrencies.
- Interaction with clients via **TCP**.

### 🖥️ The client part

The client part of the application is responsible for:

- Receiving data over **TCP** from the server side.
- Data output to a table with support for filtering and sorting arbitration bundles.
- Implementation of an authorization system that allows users to add bundles to favorites.

The client part is designed using **Qt6**, providing powerful capabilities for building a graphical interface.

## 🧪 Testing
The following testing methods are implemented in the project:

* **Server part:**

  - Unit tests to check individual components of the system.
  - Logging for tracking execution and debugging.

* **The client part:**

  - Logging to track the execution and debugging of the client application.
